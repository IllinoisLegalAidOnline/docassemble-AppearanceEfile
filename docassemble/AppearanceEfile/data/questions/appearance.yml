  Appearance with e-filing
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Appearance with e-filing** Easy Form.

  This program creates an *Appearance* form that tells the court and the other parties that you are participating in a court case. If you want a jury to decide your case, it can also make a *Jury Request*.
  
  If you are also filing a Fee waiver, you can use this program to e-file both forms.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**responding to a lawsuit**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32236).

content: |  
  The case number should be on your court papers. Look at the Complaint or Petition, or the Summons if you received one. It is usually in the top-right part of the first page.
  
  If you started the case, the court clerk should have given you the case number.
  
  In this example, the case number is **2022 EXAMPLE 123**.

  **What's the difference between a 6-person jury and a 12-person jury?**
content: |  
  The number of people on the jury can affect the cost. Usually, a 12-person jury is more expensive. Ask your local circuit clerk about the fees.
  
  In Illinois, different kinds of cases allow different size juries. A 6-person jury or a 12-person jury might not be an option for your type of court case. Contact your local circuit clerk to find out what size jury is available in your case.
  
  Use the [**Illinois Court's website**](https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/courts-directory/interactive-map/by-court-type) to look up your local circuit clerk.

  <p>Hello ${ users[0].name },</p>
  <p><strong>Your Appearance and Fee Waiver forms were sent to the Circuit Clerk of ${ trial_court.address.county } County. They will accept or reject your filing.</strong></p>
  <p>A person in the clerk's office has to accept the forms before they are officially filed.</p>
  <p><strong>What's next?</strong></p>
  <p>You should receive an email from Odyssey eFileIL (no-reply@efilingmail.tylertech.cloud). Your forms were given an Envelope Number, which will be used to track your filing.</p>
  <p>The clerk will review what you filed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If it looks good, they will <strong>accept</strong> it. You will receive another email from Odyssey eFileIL explaining that the envelope was accepted. The email will include a link to a copy of your court forms with the clerk's stamp.</li>
    <li>If there is something wrong with the filing, they will <strong>reject</strong> it. You should receive another email from Odyssey eFileIL with an explanation of what needs to be fixed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After your filing is accepted, it is your responsibility to deliver the Appearance to the other parties in your case.</p>
  <p>Make sure you record how you delivered the Appearance to the other parties in the Proof of Delivery forms.</p>
  <p><strong>Where to go for help</strong></p>
  <p>Contact the clerk at ${ trial_court.phone } to learn:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If your filing is accepted,</li>
    <li>If you have a court date for your fee waiver, and</li>
    <li>What's next in your case.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use <a href="https://efileil.tylertech.cloud/OfsEfsp/ui/landing" title="Odyssey eFileIL">Odyssey eFileIL</a> if you need to e-file other forms into your case or correct filings that the clerk rejected. You can use the same e-filing account you used to e-file your Appearance and Fee waiver.</p>
