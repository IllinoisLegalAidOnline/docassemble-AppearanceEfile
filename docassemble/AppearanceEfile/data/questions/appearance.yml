question: |
  Are you paying for the Appearance filing with a Fee waiver?
subquestion: |
  If you are paying for this appearance with a fee waiver,
  the next screens will help you make a Fee waiver.

  The circuit clerk charges filing fees for an Appearance and Jury demand. There may also be a payment processing fee.
  The amount depends on the location and type of case. You can review the fees before e-filing.

  If you cannot afford the fee, you may be eligible for a full or partial waiver.
  This depends on your income and if you receive public benefits.
